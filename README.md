## Covid-19 community transmission similarity network

### Summary
We generated a network of all US states Covid-19 community transmission data, using DTW as the measure of similarity. We also overlayed the "Most Aggressive States Against the Coronavirus" data on to this network. The results could potentially guide states towards planning for slowing down or avoiding huge covid-19 community transmission.
